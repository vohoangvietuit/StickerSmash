This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created using [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the App

Launch your app by running:

```bash
npx expo start
```

In the development server's output, you'll have options to open your app in:

- A [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- An [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- An [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a lightweight app for testing Expo projects

### Start Developing

You can begin development by editing files inside the **app** directory. This project leverages [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) for navigation.

## Resetting the Project

If you want to reset the project and start fresh, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will:

- Move the current starter code to the **app-example** directory.
- Create a new blank **app** directory for your development.
